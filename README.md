<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project called `Food Delivery App` is an prototype mobile application design which aims to prepare various foods such as: salads, seafood, chicken fillet, steak, ramstek, sandwich, risotto, pasta, pizza, hamburger. This application also aims to facilitate the purchase of foods of different categories which will be accessible to order online, giving you the opportunity to choose your favorite food. In this mobile application design you can navigate into different pages which are “Welcome and Get started”, “Sign up”, “Confirm and Verify Account”, “Log in”, “Guest”, “Home”, “Orders”, “Account”, “Settings”, “Search for Food Products”, “Food Product Categories”, “Offerings about Foods”, “Salads”, “Seafood”, “Chicken fillet”, “Steak”, “Sandwich”, “Risotto”, “Pasta”, “Pizza”, “Hamburger”, “Product Details”, “Quality and Price”, “Add to your order or Buy now”, “If you're Guest you need to Log in to Continue”, “If you're Registered you can Continue”, “Proceed to checkout”, “Delivery Address”, “Card Details”, “If all fields are successfully filled you can Continue”, “Purchase of Product”, “Thanks for Purchasing” and “The Order is in Delivery”.

This project started from scratch where I worked and completed, also I made some improvements in the UI/UX Design, such as creating the User Persona for target audience, creating the User Flows of application, designing the Wireframes without content, making of the UI Design of application, standardization of color, font, icon pack and grid layout for pages, then making of the UI Prototype of application where all pages are connected and functional to run as mobile application prototype design and many more things.
